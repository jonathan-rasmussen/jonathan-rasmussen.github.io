	<h1>Hello there, I'm Jonathan Rasmussen!</h1>
	<p>I'm a Canadian engineer working as a macine learning engineer. In my spare time I love to read, play the piano, and build robots. My <a href="/about">Life Experience</a></p> has taught me many things about Science, Mathematics, Philosphy, Social Studies, The Arts, and Physical/Mental Health. However, I recognize that there is so many more wonders of Humanity and the Universe to learn about. Therefore it is my personal mission to strive everday to be the best version of myself and dedicate everday to knowledge, empathy, and the pursuit of happiness.
